 README - PROJECTS folder for CovidSIMVL
 
 2021.02.15
	   
WARNING - the .js and .html files in all these projects are what was used to run the results. However, time and the tides have moved
to gradually find and repair errors and unexpected features (bugs), so that using these for other than their time-based contexts is
not advisable.

Rather, the most current universal version is in /Simulation Engines/PRIMARY CovidSIMVL

These projects include many intermediate development pieces of code and outputs which are only of archival significance
The reader is invited to dive into them at their own peril.

HOWEVER, to make things somewhat easier, the project folders are prefixed with DATES, and this should assist in establishing
relevance.

*** FURTHER TO WARNING ****

Not all folders will have a _READMD.txt file. The titles are usually self-explanatory, and the folders should contain either notes, manuscripts, papers or
results (in Excel files) for the Project - all of which give the discerning reader a guide as to the motivation and outcomes of the project.
