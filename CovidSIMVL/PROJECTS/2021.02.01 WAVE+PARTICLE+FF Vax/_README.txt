 README - WAVE+PARTICLE+FF Vax Project

 Please read the _README.txt for the preceding project WAVE+PARTICLE.
 This is an addition to the prototype, removing the 14 days of zero protection after the first jab.
 The default built into this model is Mode2 - 80% after jab2 for 14 days then 95%
 Both these versions log resistance by the susceptible AS WELL AS reduced transmissibility by the infectious
 The infectivity is the complement of the vaccine efficacy - ie if the resistance as a susceptible is 95%,
     the infectivity is 1-95% = 5%. So the random number has to be > 0.95 for infection to be considered.
	 
 The comparative improvement from FF has to be taken with a grain of salt, as it has the added advantage that at the
 time of jab2, when T=0, the FF version has many days to build the cohort of infectives while the full 28 day model
 has had 14 days to build up transmitters by the time jab2 occurs.
 The time after jab2 in the 28-day and the FF-model are different....the thetas will be smaller for the full model
 and there will be more survivors in FF just because of this - the starting time also has acceleration lag, so the
 survivors in this period will be less, in addition to the protective efficacy.
 
 The FF supplement is the one in which vaccinations were given 3 schedules, one of which only were the young. The
 Excel console.logs would show which age groups were vaccinated, thus placing the data in the appropriate project.
