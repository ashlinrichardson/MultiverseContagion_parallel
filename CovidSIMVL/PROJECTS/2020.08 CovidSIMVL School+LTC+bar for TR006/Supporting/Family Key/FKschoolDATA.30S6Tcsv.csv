Fundamental Model,,,,,,,
,"3 study-bubbles of students of 10 each, labelled A, B, C",,,,,,
,,"two groups overlap during playground, lunch and hallway/washroom",,,,,
,,(we can of course change this),,,,,
,,students come at 9 and leave at 4pm,,,,,
,,they go home,,,,,
,6 teachers T0 - T7,"supervise one for single group, two four doubled groups",,,,,
,,teachers have a lounge called OFFICE,,,,,
,,teachers come at 8 and leave at 5pm,,,,,
,,they go home,,,,,

,Distribution of work for teachers is 5-5-5-4-5-5 for teachers T0-T5 respectively,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
THIS IS THE BARE BONES OF THE MODEL SCENARIO,,,,,,,
FROM HERE WE CAN GO IN MANY DIRECTIONS,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
1. We can add one or more infectives (pardon my language) to either student or teacher,,,,,,,
, - we can vary the sizes and mingle factors to get the odds that we want,,,,,,
, - this direction will permit us to see the spread of transmission within this constrained population,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
2. This is only 36 persons - we could go up to 100 easily,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
 3. We can add parents and family structures so that infections at home (universe 8) ONLY happen between family members,,,,,,,
," This way, we can track the spread among family members given infected teachers and students",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"4. We can add a bar for U7 and let teachers go to the bars. We can populate the bars with high ""others"" who just go home or to bars",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"5. We can reduce some of the many spaces we have in the fundamental model, and introduce LTC, bar, office as Universes and have complex movement patterns",,,,,,,
