 README - 2020.08 CovidSIMVL Territory and Footprint Studies PROJECT

 With apologies, this is a rabbit hole with folders within folders, and goes back in time.
 It encompasses the entire development from a single fixed arena to the full multiverse separating the html file from the .js files.
 So a lot of the CONSTRUCTION folder is relative to running a single .html file.
 
 Furthermore, there are many small sub-projects within the CONSTRUCTION folder which investigate multiple panes, and multiple displays and counts,
 and the network graph visualization of persons moving hourly according to schedule from one universe to another, and the different
 charts for the Universes, as well as the whole, and the transition to a single Universe view so parameters can be set for specific
 universes. 
 
 The .csv file describing movements of sub-populations by schedule, the family structure, the roles, and other features not yet used such
 as epicenters within a Universe for clustering, or co-morbid risk factors, were also constructed in this set of .html programs and
 spreadsheet results.
 
 As the need for data grew, the console.logs became more informative, so that dynamics could be tracked, and the concepts for theta and 
 for transmission trees and their Q-values revealed themselves. These are all in this folder.
 
 The PRIMARY folder really points to the manuscript describing the "Anatomy of the Multiverse" or some such words, as well as the conceptual
 definition of the population schedule and cohorts, and the .CSV file resulting.
 
 The SUPPORTING folder contains all the history, and again, with apologies, the unravelling of this may not be simple, if one really wants
 to go into the history. Best efforts have been made to put all the partial prototyping into CONSTRUCTION.
 
 The currently uptodate CovidSIMVL with all the features (to date) of vaccination with age demographics is in the project

Some of the earliest starts to building the entire agent-based model, which began with the single arena, are in the PROJECT files
