Territory and Footprint - no viral model, just study of stochastic movements resulting from mF and to a lesser
   extent, HzR in trying to get standard population DENSITY model ie persons to area so that when k persons move into
   arena 800x600 and we want the infection risks to be similar to a more populated arena, we know how to set the
   mF and HzR....if we want equivalence....it may be that when 5 persons instead of 50 persons move into a space, the
   implicit probability SHOULD be less...
   
   However, in the case of U.HOME we have lots of persons crowded into U.HOME but only family members infect one
   another, and we do not know how to set the mF and HzR so they infect one another at a probability equivalent to
   what we would like - which is what?
   
   That is what motivates this study
