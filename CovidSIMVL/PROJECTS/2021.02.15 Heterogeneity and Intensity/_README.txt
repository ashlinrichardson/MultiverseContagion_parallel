2021.02.20 Birth-Death Studies

The idea was to see how the rate of new infections exceed the rate of deaths at any particular moment in time - gen, but after realizing that 8 days is not 8 generations but much more, the end result is anyway that the death curve PARALLELS the BIRTH curve of infectives, but with a constant lag.

Most of the calculations and graphs are in error but one - and that is because the days for REDs were used as gens....

Nevertheless, the main thing to learn is that at any particular moment, there may be because of the lag, and the shape of the growth of infectives, a very large gap between deaths (turning orange) and births (turning yellow).....but other things, like the pileup of red agents, do not show here...

This led to the temporary abandonment of this project, in favor of the  more detailed STATE-COMPOSITION (aka STRUCTURE) studies in the eponymous project....
