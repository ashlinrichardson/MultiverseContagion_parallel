TRIAL 1,2 Universes,,0,8,,,
,,,ChildCare,Home,,,
,,,,,,,
,staff leave home and come home,,,,,,
,other family members stay home,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,set parameters to get 16 infections in 16 days,,,,,,
,with goal of 3 children and 4 adults infected at home by day 14,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Scenario 2,,,,,,,
,LTC50,combinations of 1 worker for 8hrs,,,,worker has high mingle factor,
,,,plus 1 visitor for 2 hr,,,,
,,do this by varying csv file,,,,,
,ED100,combinations of 1 worker for 8hrs,,,,,
,,,plus 1 patient for 4 hrs,,,,
,,do this by varying csv file,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,The introduced staff and visitors go back to the first scenario,,,,,,
,,of Childcare + their families,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,There is no guarantee as to when the chosen workers and visitors go to the ED and LTC,,,,,,
,,there is a complex system of schedules and tickets for each person established at load time,,,,,
,,"hard to dynamically allow one to leave, or to choose the one which is infected (except for the initial transmitter)",,,,,
,,"but that person is a staff member and can't work, though they could be a patient or visitor",,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,so we only have the ED+LTC worker to worry about,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,1. we could set a gate at EXPEL and INJECT to allow just one person through with the role of A,,,,,
,,,with the idea that everyone goes (or half go),,,,
,,2. we could just designate our person as one of the Adults (4 in total),,,,,
,,,they go daily and eventually will become infected,,,,
,,,"after infection, they have 2 days of incubation, and 6 days of infection",,,,
,,,"during those 6 days, they will be infecting their:",,,,
,,,,a) family,,,
,,,,b) their work/visit place daily,,,
,,,,,,,
,,so we will  pick ,,Adult 26 as the LTC visitor,,,2hrs ; mingleFactor 1.5
,,,,Adult 30 as LTC worker,,,8hrs; mF = 3
,,,,Adult 47 as ED patient,,,4hrs; mF=1
,,,,Adult 51 as ED staff ,,,10hrs; mF=3
,,,,,,,
,,,,LTC50,Universe 1,expansion 3.5; SymptDays = 3,
,,,,ED100,Universe 2,expnasion 3.5; SymptDays = 3,
,,,,,"we want a different 100 each day, which complicates matters",,
,,,,,,how do we do this?,
