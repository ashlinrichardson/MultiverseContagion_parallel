 There is a need to carefully distinguish between this project and the next one with "Fast Forward"
 This project introduces the notion of slow spread through wave front, and rapid spread through random dispersal of infectives
 This is the project that constructs the synthetic population demographic to fit with BC's age-based infection experience
 
 HOWEVER, in this one only the 90+, 80, and 70 year olds are vaccinated. This is the big difference if looking at EXCEL sheets
 you wonder which ran what.
 
 Also, you may have to look in the code, which would be expected in the title (name) to state FF....
 But in the code, in VLtransfer() routine, there is a section that checks on VAX status, and that is
 where the bounds are.
 
 For this one, the bounds are: T.0 to T.14 0% protection, then 75% for 14 days, then 95% thereafter
