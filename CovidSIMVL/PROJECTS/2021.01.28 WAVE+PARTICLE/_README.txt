 README - WAVE+PARTICLE Project
 
 2021.02.15
 
 A bit complicated. Two things going on here:
 
 1. The introduction of the concept that there are two extremes of mobility - one localized, the other in big jumps
 2. These were initially called ANT vs FLEA, but have been revised to WAVE vs PARTICLE 
 3. In fact these concepts are not in the title because it is not really a "vs" competition
 
 4. However, they just set the stage for application to the scenarios of vaccination - which has better outcomes?
 5. The main results are in the folder "Ant vs Flea Paper" - that is, the Excel spreadsheet with analyses embedded
 6. The .js and csv files may be suspect, since at this time the NaN bug was not yet fixed; so re-running would be best
    with current version....but note
 7. These runs are done with a single Universe in the MV framework - so 1,000 identical agents were used, who stayed in U0
 8. Some trials were run with different numbers of initial infectors
 
 9. To find out the results of ANT vs FLEA, please read the manuscript or pre-print.
 10.The Fast Forward modification is its own PROJECT, closely following in date and title.
