 README - CovidSIMVL Documents folder
 
 2021.02.15
 
 This folder contains:
 1. Manuscripts and Notes
 2. Publications
 3. Powerpoints
 
 Any relevant external documents regarding this project and agent-based models, etc. are NOT here, though there may be an argument for
 completeness to include them, but that is a project for a different person and a different time.
 
 Publications have one folder:
 medrxiv.org
 
 If any other formal publications in journals, conferences, etc may later appear, they will be added. Meanwhile, our belief is that them
 most effective communication tool in the Internet age are pre=print sites like medrxiv.org.
 
 The powerpoints may be repetitive but is a chronology of communications, and the visual condensations add to understanding the concepts
 that have unfolded as the project has evolved.
